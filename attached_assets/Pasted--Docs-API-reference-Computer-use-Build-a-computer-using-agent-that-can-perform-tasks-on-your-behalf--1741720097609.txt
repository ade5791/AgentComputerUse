Computer use
Build a computer-using agent that can perform tasks on your behalf.
Overview

Computer use is a practical application of our Computer-Using Agent (CUA) model, computer-use-preview, which combines the vision capabilities of GPT-4o with advanced reasoning to simulate controlling computer interfaces and performing tasks.

Computer use is available through the Responses API. It is not available on Chat Completions.

Computer use is in beta. Because the model is still in preview and may be susceptible to exploits and inadvertent mistakes, we discourage trusting it in fully authenticated environments or for high-stakes tasks. See limitations and risk and safety best practices below. You must use the Computer Use tool in line with OpenAI's Usage Policy and Business Terms.
How it works

The computer use tool operates in a continuous loop. It sends computer actions, like click(x,y) or type(text), which your code executes on a computer or browser environment and then returns screenshots of the outcomes back to the model.

In this way, your code simulates the actions of a human using a computer interface, while our model uses the screenshots to understand the state of the environment and suggest next actions.

This loop lets you automate many tasks requiring clicking, typing, scrolling, and more. For example, booking a flight, searching for a product, or filling out a form.

Refer to the integration section below for more details on how to integrate the computer use tool, or check out our sample app repository to set up an environment and try example integrations.

Examples of how to integrate the computer use tool in different environments
Setting up your environment

Before integrating the tool, prepare an environment that can capture screenshots and execute the recommended actions. We recommend using a sandboxed environment for safety reasons.
Set up a local browsing environment

If you want to try out the computer use tool with minimal setup, you can use a browser automation framework such as Playwright or Selenium.

Running a browser automation framework locally can pose security risks. We recommend the following setup to mitigate them:

    Use a sandboxed environment
    Set env to an empty object to avoid exposing host environment variables to the browser
    Set flags to disable extensions and the file system

Start a browser instance

You can start browser instances using your preferred language by installing the corresponding SDK.

For example, to start a Playwright browser instance, install the Playwright SDK:

    Python: pip install playwright
    JavaScript: npm i playwright then npx playwright install

Then run the following code:
Start a browser instance

from playwright.sync_api import sync_playwright

with sync_playwright() as p:
    browser = p.chromium.launch(
        headless=False,
        chromium_sandbox=True,
        env={},
        args=[
            "--disable-extensions",
            "--disable-file-system"
        ]
    )
    page = browser.new_page()
    page.set_viewport_size({"width": 1024, "height": 768})
    page.goto("https://bing.com")

    page.wait_for_timeout(10000)

Set up a local virtual machine
Integrating the CUA loop

These are the high-level steps you need to follow to integrate the computer use tool in your application:

    Send a request to the model: Include the computer tool as part of the available tools, specifying the display size and environment. You can also include in the first request a screenshot of the initial state of the environment.

    Receive a response from the model: Check if the response has any computer_call items. This tool call contains a suggested action to take to progress towards the specified goal. These actions could be clicking at a given position, typing in text, scrolling, or even waiting.

    Execute the requested action: Execute through code the corresponding action on your computer or browser environment.

    Capture the updated state: After executing the action, capture the updated state of the environment as a screenshot.

    Repeat: Send a new request with the updated state as a computer_call_output, and repeat this loop until the model stops requesting actions or you decide to stop.

Computer use diagram
1. Send a request to the model

Send a request to create a Response with the computer-use-preview model equipped with the computer_use_preview tool. This request should include details about your environment, along with an initial input prompt.

Optionally, you can include a screenshot of the initial state of the environment.

To be able to use the computer_use_preview tool, you need to set the truncation parameter to "auto" (by default, truncation is disabled).
Send a CUA request

from openai import OpenAI
client = OpenAI()

response = client.responses.create(
    model="computer-use-preview",
    tools=[{
        "type": "computer_use_preview",
        "display_width": 1024,
        "display_height": 768,
        "environment": "browser" # other possible values: "mac", "windows", "ubuntu"
    }],
    input=[
        {
            "role": "user",
            "content": "Check the latest OpenAI news on bing.com."
        }
        # Optional: include a screenshot of the initial state of the environment
        # {
        #     type: "input_image",
        #     image_url: f"data:image/png;base64,{screenshot_base64}"
        # }
    ],
    truncation="auto"
)

print(response.output)

2. Receive a suggested action

The model returns an output that contains either a computer_call item, just text, or other tool calls, depending on the state of the conversation.

Examples of computer_call items are a click, a scroll, a key press, or any other event defined in the API reference. In our example, the item is a click action:
CUA suggested action

"output": [
    {
        "type": "reasoning",
        "id": "rs_67cc...",
        "content": []
    },
    {
        "type": "computer_call",
        "id": "cu_67cc...",
        "call_id": "call_zw3...",
        "action": {
            "type": "click",
            "button": "left",
            "x": 156,
            "y": 50
        },
        "pending_safety_checks": [],
        "status": "completed"
    }
]

Reasoning items

The model may return a reasoning item in the response output for some actions. If it does, you should always include back the reasoning items when sending the next request to the CUA model.

The reasoning items are only compatible with the same model that produced them. If you implement a flow where you use several models with the same conversation history, you should filter these reasoning items out of the inputs array you send to other models.
Safety checks

The model may return safety checks with the pending_safety_check parameter. Refer to the section on how to acknowledge safety checks below for more details.
3. Execute the action in your environment

Execute the corresponding actions on your computer or browser. How you map a computer call to actions through code depends on your environment. This code shows example implementations for the most common computer actions.
Execute the action

def handle_model_action(vm, action):
    """
    Given a computer action (e.g., click, double_click, scroll, etc.),
    execute the corresponding operation on the Docker environment.
    """
    action_type = action.type

    try:
        match action_type:
            
            case "click":
                x, y = int(action.x), int(action.y)
                button_map = {"left": 1, "middle": 2, "right": 3}
                b = button_map.get(action.button, 1)
                print(f"Action: click at ({x}, {y}) with button '{action.button}'")
                docker_exec(f"DISPLAY={vm.display} xdotool mousemove {x} {y} click {b}", vm.container_name)

            case "scroll":
                x, y = int(action.x), int(action.y)
                scroll_x, scroll_y = int(action.scroll_x), int(action.scroll_y)
                print(f"Action: scroll at ({x}, {y}) with offsets (scroll_x={scroll_x}, scroll_y={scroll_y})")
                docker_exec(f"DISPLAY={vm.display} xdotool mousemove {x} {y}", vm.container_name)
                
                # For vertical scrolling, use button 4 (scroll up) or button 5 (scroll down)
                if scroll_y != 0:
                    button = 4 if scroll_y < 0 else 5
                    clicks = abs(scroll_y)
                    for _ in range(clicks):
                        docker_exec(f"DISPLAY={vm.display} xdotool click {button}", vm.container_name)
            
            case "keypress":
                keys = action.keys
                for k in keys:
                    print(f"Action: keypress '{k}'")
                    # A simple mapping for common keys; expand as needed.
                    if k.lower() == "enter":
                        docker_exec(f"DISPLAY={vm.display} xdotool key 'Return'", vm.container_name)
                    elif k.lower() == "space":
                        docker_exec(f"DISPLAY={vm.display} xdotool key 'space'", vm.container_name)
                    else:
                        docker_exec(f"DISPLAY={vm.display} xdotool key '{k}'", vm.container_name)
            
            case "type":
                text = action.text
                print(f"Action: type text: {text}")
                docker_exec(f"DISPLAY={vm.display} xdotool type '{text}'", vm.container_name)
            
            case "wait":
                print(f"Action: wait")
                time.sleep(2)

            case "screenshot":
                # Nothing to do as screenshot is taken at each turn
                print(f"Action: screenshot")
            
            # Handle other actions here

            case _:
                print(f"Unrecognized action: {action}")

    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Error handling action {action}: {e}")

4. Capture the updated screenshot

After executing the action, capture the updated state of the environment as a screenshot, which also differs depending on your environment.
Capture and send the updated screenshot

def get_screenshot(vm):
    """
    Takes a screenshot, returning raw bytes.
    """
    cmd = (
        f"export DISPLAY={vm.display} && "
        "import -window root png:-"
    )
    screenshot_bytes = docker_exec(cmd, vm.container_name, decode=False)
    return screenshot_bytes

5. Repeat

Once you have the screenshot, you can send it back to the model as a computer_call_output to get the next action. Repeat these steps as long as you get a computer_call item in the response.
Repeat steps in a loop

import time
import base64
from openai import OpenAI
client = OpenAI()

def computer_use_loop(instance, response):
    """
    Run the loop that executes computer actions until no 'computer_call' is found.
    """
    while True:
        computer_calls = [item for item in response.output if item.type == "computer_call"]
        if not computer_calls:
            print("No computer call found. Output from model:")
            for item in response.output:
                print(item)
            break  # Exit when no computer calls are issued.

        # We expect at most one computer call per response.
        computer_call = computer_calls[0]
        last_call_id = computer_call.call_id
        action = computer_call.action

        # Execute the action (function defined in step 3)
        handle_model_action(instance, action)
        time.sleep(1)  # Allow time for changes to take effect.

        # Take a screenshot after the action (function defined in step 4)
        screenshot_bytes = get_screenshot(instance)
        screenshot_base64 = base64.b64encode(screenshot_bytes).decode("utf-8")

        # Send the screenshot back as a computer_call_output
        response = client.responses.create(
            model="computer-use-preview",
            previous_response_id=response.id,
            tools=[
                {
                    "type": "computer_use_preview",
                    "display_width": 1024,
                    "display_height": 768,
                    "environment": "browser"
                }
            ],
            input=[
                {
                    "call_id": last_call_id,
                    "type": "computer_call_output",
                    "output": {
                        "type": "input_image",
                        "image_url": f"data:image/png;base64,{screenshot_base64}"
                    }
                }
            ],
            truncation="auto"
        )

    return response

Handling conversation history

You can use the previous_response_id parameter to link the current request to the previous response. We recommend using this method if you don't want to manage the conversation history on your side.

If you do not want to use this parameter, you should make sure to include in your inputs array all the items returned in the response output of the previous request, including reasoning items if present.
Acknowledge safety checks

We have implemented safety checks in the API to help protect against prompt injection and model mistakes. These checks include:

    Malicious instruction detection: we evaluate the screenshot image and check if it contains adversarial content that may change the model's behavior.
    Irrelevant domain detection: we evaluate the current_url (if provided) and check if the current domain is considered relevant given the conversation history.
    Sensitive domain detection: we check the current_url (if provided) and raise a warning when we detect the user is on a sensitive domain.

If one or multiple of the above checks is triggered, a safety check is raised when the model returns the next computer_call, with the pending_safety_checks parameter.
Pending safety checks

"output": [
    {
        "type": "reasoning",
        "id": "rs_67cb...",
        "content": [
            {
                "type": "reasoning_summary",
                "text": "Exploring 'File' menu option."
            }
        ]
    },
    {
        "type": "computer_call",
        "id": "cu_67cb...",
        "call_id": "call_nEJ...",
        "action": {
            "type": "click",
            "button": "left",
            "x": 135,
            "y": 193
        },
        "pending_safety_checks": [
            {
                "id": "cu_sc_67cb...",
                "code": "malicious_instructions",
                "message": "We've detected instructions that may cause your application to perform malicious or unauthorized actions. Please acknowledge this warning if you'd like to proceed."
            }
        ],
        "status": "completed"
    }
]

You need to pass the safety checks back as acknowledged_safety_checks in the next request in order to proceed. In all cases where pending_safety_checks are returned, actions should be handed over to the end user to confirm model behavior and accuracy.

    malicious_instructions and irrelevant_domain: end users should review model actions and confirm that the model is behaving as intended.
    sensitive_domain: ensure an end user is actively monitoring the model actions on these sites. Exact implementation of this "watch mode" may vary by application, but a potential example could be collecting user impression data on the site to make sure there is active end user engagement with the application.

Final code

Putting it all together, the final code should include:

    The initialization of the environment
    A first request to the model with the computer tool
    A loop that executes the suggested action in your environment
    A way to acknowledge safety checks and give end users a chance to confirm actions

Examples of how to integrate the computer use tool in different environments
Limitations

We recommend using the computer-use-preview model for browser-based tasks. The model may be susceptible to inadvertent model mistakes, especially in non-browser environments that it is less used to.

For example, computer-use-preview's performance on OSWorld is currently 38.1%, indicating that the model is not yet highly reliable for automating tasks on an OS. More details about the model and related safety work can be found in our updated system card.

Some other behavior limitations to be aware of:

    The computer-use-preview model has constrained rate limits and feature support, described on its model detail page.
    This tool does not support zero data retention (data retention policies).

Risks and safety

Computer use presents unique risks that differ from those in standard API features or chat interfaces, especially when interacting with the internet.

There are a number of best practices listed below that you should follow to mitigate these risks.
Human in the loop for high-stakes tasks

Avoid tasks that are high-stakes or require high levels of accuracy. The model may make mistakes that are challenging to reverse. As mentioned above, the model is still prone to mistakes, especially on non-browser surfaces. While we expect the model to request user confirmation before proceeding with certain higher-impact decisions, this is not fully reliable. Ensure a human is in the loop to confirm model actions with real-world consequences.
Beware of prompt injections

A prompt injection occurs when an AI model mistakenly follows untrusted instructions appearing in its input. For the computer-use-preview model, this may manifest as it seeing something in the provided screenshot, like a malicious website or email, that instructs it to do something that the user does not want, and it complies. To avoid prompt injection risk, limit computer use access to trusted, isolated environments like a sandboxed browser or container.
Use blocklists and allowlists

Implement a blocklist or an allowlist of websites, actions, and users. For example, if you're using the computer use tool to book tickets on a website, create an allowlist of only the websites you expect to use in that workflow.
Send user IDs

Send end-user IDs (optional param) to help OpenAI monitor and detect abuse.
Use our safety checks

The following safety checks are available to protect against prompt injection and model mistakes:

    Malicious instruction detection
    Irrelevant domain detection
    Sensitive domain detection

When you receive a pending_safety_check, you should increase oversight into model actions, for example by handing over to an end user to explicitly acknowledge the desire to proceed with the task and ensure that the user is actively monitoring the agent's actions (e.g., by implementing something like a watch mode similar to Operator). Essentially, when safety checks fire, a human should come into the loop.

Read the acknowledge safety checks section above for more details on how to proceed when you receive a pending_safety_check.

Where possible, it is highly recommended to pass in the optional parameter current_url as part of the computer_call_output, as it can help increase the accuracy of our safety checks.
Using current URL

{
    "type": "computer_call_output",
    "call_id": "call_7OU...",
    "acknowledged_safety_checks": [],
    "output": {
        "type": "computer_screenshot",
        "image_url": "..."
    },
    "current_url": "https://openai.com"
}

Additional safety precautions

Implement additional safety precautions as best suited for your application, such as implementing guardrails that run in parallel of the computer use loop.
